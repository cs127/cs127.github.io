        <h1>info / about me</h1>

        <p>
            hi! I'm cs, a music producer, programmer, and minecraft player.<br/>
            I'm 19 years old, and I go by any pronouns, but I prefer they/them.
        </p>

        <p>
            I can speak English, Persian, and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona">toki pona<span class="fgc8">[→]</span></a>.
            <br/>
            and I am currently learning Japanese.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was born on 2005-04-04 (4th of April 2005), in Tehran, Iran.<br/>
            I currently still live there, but I will most likely leave as soon as possible.<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            I started experimenting with music when I was 5 years old.<br/>
            most songs that I made until 2020 were MIDI files.<br/>
            my first proper song was an XG MIDI version of
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waeORffPeFY">&quot;16-bit&quot;<span class="fgc8">[→]</span></a>,
            which I made in 2019.<br/>
            in late 2020, I started using
            <a href="https://openmpt.org">OpenMPT<span class="fgc8">[→]</span></a>
            to make my songs, which is now my main choice for music production.<br/>
            in fact, I became so obsessed with OpenMPT that I wrote
            <a href="https://wiki.openmpt.org/Development:_228_Extensions">a part of its file format documentation<span class="fgc8">[→]</span></a>. :3
        </p>

        <p>
            most of my music is inspired by synthwave and 1980s synthpop,<br/>
            but I also sometimes make
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune">chiptune<span class="fgc8">[→]</span></a>
            and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demoscene<span class="fgc8">[→]</span></a>-style
            music.
        </p>

        <p>
            as for programming, I started learning the very basics in 2013.<br/>
            my main language was BASIC, until I learnt a bit of Java in 2020, and later, C, in 2022.<br/>
            I also know a little bit of Python, but not as much as C and Java.
        </p>
